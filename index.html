			<pre>The first alleged recorded use of Cannabis as a medicine was way, way back, between 2696 – 2737 BC in China by legendary Emperor Shen Nung (the same guy who is said to have invented tea). Nung was fabled as a philosopher, farmer and hemp enthusiast, whose documentation of the plant’s ‘yin energy’ for malaria, dysentery, constipation and rheumatic pains is considered the first pharmacopoeia entry (an encyclopaedia of medicines detailing their effects and uses).
				
Over in Africa, there are records of medicinal use of cannabis in The Egyptian Ebers Papyrus – a preserved medical document that dates to about 1550BC – for treatment in fever, pain and uterine contraction. Across the Mediterranean, Dioscorides – private physician to the Roman Emperor Nero – documented it as a treatment “for pains of the ears”. Meanwhile, from the 8th to the 18th century, evidence shows that the Arab world used it as a painkiller, anti-inflammatory and anti-epileptic.

									<figcaption>For many decades in the U.S., marijuana has been painted as the psychedelic drug of hippies and stoners who lay around smoking dope to the detriment of their cognitive function. This image of marijuana use can certainly be attributed to one aspect of its culture, but Cannabis — a category of plants that include three species and seven sub-species — have been used in medicine for thousands of years.</figcaption>

									<figcaption>Ancient and medieval physicians mixed the plant into medicines or teas to treat pain and other ailments; back then, it wasn’t a highly controlled substance the way it is today, where in the U.S. it’s listed as a Schedule I drug along with LSD and heroin. Here’s a brief history of medical cannabis to better understand the level of its efficacy in treatments and therapies.</figcaption>

									<figcaption>In the ancient world, hemp was a common agricultural crop — harvested for its high-protein seeds, oil, and fiber used for rope and clothes. Hemp is one variety of the Cannabis plant, but it doesn’t have the same mind-altering effects as marijuana.</figcaption>

									<figcaption>In ancient China and elsewhere in the world, however, hemp was grown for food and had hundreds of other uses — so it was only natural for people to discover that other types of the Cannabis plant could be used medicinally. The spread of medicinal cannabis first started in China, then traveled throughout Asia into the Middle East and Africa. In ancient times, cannabis was used to alleviate pain and treat various conditions. But doctors also warned against using it too much, as they believed it could cause people to “see demons.”</figcaption>

									<figcaption>2000-1400 B.C. Compared to the Western world and even other parts of Asia like China and Japan, India had always remained closely tied to cannabis use — medicinally, religiously, recreationally, and spiritually. Cannabis was and continues to be mixed into special drinks that are used for simple enjoyment but also for medical reasons. One of the most popular of these drinks is bhang — a mix of cannabis paste (made from the buds and leaves), milk, ghee, and spices.</figcaption>
